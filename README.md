### Description
In the course of this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis, which encompassed the creation of summaries for quantitative features, the computation of central tendencies, and the visualization of quantitative variables. Additionally, I leveraged the capabilities of the pandas library, specifically the use of the .value_counts() method. This method enabled the generation of frequency counts for all unique values within a DataFrame column.
